# Capital-Bikeshare-Traffic-Planning
Project as a part of coursework for Introduction to Machine Learning Class in UT Austin's MS Business Analytics Program.

Bike sharing is one of the most accessible way to commute for employees and students. Lime and Bird were the commonly used bikes in Austin especially for student commute and it is interesting to see how the membership, payment and trips have become more automatic.

Inspired by these observations, we took the trips data from Capital Bikeshare to predict the demand of bike users based on the number of rides pertaining to registered and casual users.
